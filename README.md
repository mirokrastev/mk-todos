## Features
This is a fully functioning Todo site. Some of the site features include:

  * Check your Todo
  * Change your Todo
  * Complete or delete your Todo

* Teams:
  * You can create team and invite your friends to share Todos!
  * Full CRUD control, as stated above
  
* User Profile. This means that you can:
  * Update it with your cool avatar
  * you can give it a bio. Something memorable, or just how you feel today :)
  * And finally you can check others' people profile! And don't worry about the email field in your User Profile page! It's visible to only you.

* Fully working Dark Mode:
  * This project has fully working Dark Mode. You just need to turn it on from the settings!
  * It's using DarkReader JS code to generate dynamically dark page. It's sooo convenient!

* Some miscellaneous stuff:
  * Query string handling with templatetag.
  * I made it really simple for administrators to handle the site traffic.
  * Password reset feature.
  * Caching system with Middleware.
  * There are other things that make up my site, but the ```README``` will become too bloated.
